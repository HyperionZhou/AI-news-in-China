1. Macaron: AI + Hardware -> modify videos.
Macaron is an app that can help people easily modify pictures and videos on their phones. Now, combining powerful
video segmentation AI model application with Apple A13 Bionic chip, it can fulfill real-time videoâ€™s rendering which
used to be implemented by professional working station.

Moreover, Macaron is a member of Tencent AI accelerator. This project is also helped a lot by Tencent.

2. Films repairing AI techniques
Currently, there are some AI based techniques trying to repair old roll film. For example, Deepsense AI repairs 
<Gone with the wind>. In China, an AI called Shensi transform a 720 x 576 film to a 2k or even larger film,
repairing its quality simultaneously. 
This system uses Deep Learning, GAN, DenseNet, CycleGAN, and  so on. It has three main modules including resolution 
augmenting module, digital image repairing module.
The highlight is that the system is trained separately to solve different videos problems. Also, it uses cycle
network to improve efficiency and stability.

3. Using AI to cultivate vegetables. Tencent x WUR smart greenhouse competition.
They use greenhouse cultivating simulator to calculate the growing performance under certain environment
circumstances. They also implements a evaluating the gains, like how sweet the tomatoes are and how much money 
they may earn in the market.
The AI is tuning temperature, sunlight, CO2, and so on. On theoretical way, this may produce 10 times profits
than usual. However, in reality, the growing performance may be opposite.
