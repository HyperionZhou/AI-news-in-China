1.  Zhongnanshan team and Tencent set up a joint laboratory of big data and artificial intelligence to tackle the epidemic prevention and control AI

The new crown epidemic makes everyone feel the threat of the epidemic. How can we end this fight as soon as possible? How to establish long-term prevention and control mechanism and ability? The medical and technological circles are not idle.
On February 26, the academician team of Zhong Nanshan and Tencent officially reached a cooperation to jointly establish the "Joint Laboratory of big data and artificial intelligence", with Zhong Nanshan as the laboratory director.
It a pressing matter of the moment that novel coronavirus pneumonia is the first priority for both sides to work together to fight the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
But the longer-term goal is to use big data and artificial intelligence to tackle epidemic, respiratory and chest disease screening and prevention and early warning.


Challenge 1: screening mechanism for high risk groups
When there are signs of an epidemic, the key to control the epidemic is to find the high-risk groups at the first time.
For the novel coronavirus pneumonia, influenza, hand foot mouth and other epidemic diseases and respiratory diseases, the two sides will build a screening mechanism under the line and offline.
Online, the mechanism will screen high-risk groups and provide medical guidance through platforms such as Tencent health applet.
Offline, it provides linkage ability for fever clinic, community basic health service institutions and medical institutions to assist in epidemic screening, prediction and prevention and control.
Novel coronavirus pneumonia has been used in the new crown pneumonia outbreak.
Wechat "payment" page is a "medical and health" service open to users all over the country. It has brought 1 billion people with practical epidemic services such as epidemic dynamics, medical science popularization, self diagnosis and self inspection, online free diagnosis, fever clinic map, etc.


Breakthrough 2: artificial intelligence disease screening
In the traditional medical process, a chest CT examination can often produce about 300 images, which will take 5-15 minutes for doctors to read only by naked eyes.
In this link, artificial intelligence assisted film reading will make great achievements.
But AI itself can't learn without a teacher. AI also needs a famous teacher to be a master. In terms of lung disease interpretation and screening, Zhong Nanshan's team will become Tencent AI's best mentor and learning partner.
In the future, the two sides will further study the interpretation and screening technology of artificial intelligence for all lung diseases by combining various inspection reports such as X-ray and CT images.
A current sample is novel coronavirus pneumonia, which is equipped with the "Tencent search" AI medical imaging and Tencent cloud technology artificial intelligence CT devices, which are deployed in a number of hospitals in Hubei. The fastest 2 seconds can identify the new crown pneumonia, which greatly alleviates the pressure of inadequate local CT screening.


Breakthrough 3: national disease reporting and prediction and early warning system
The novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic is coming suddenly. How to prevent the epidemic epidemic in the future? This is also a key topic for Zhong Nanshan's academician team and Tencent to break through.
In this regard, the joint laboratory will use artificial intelligence to assist clinical decision-making technology, continue to carry out multi center clinical research throughout the country, establish a disease reporting and prediction early warning system that radiates the whole country, and realize auxiliary clinical diagnosis and treatment scheme decision-making, follow-up, efficacy evaluation and prognosis evaluation.
When novel coronavirus pneumonia is encountered in the future, the ability of laboratory research and prevention and early warning may play a role.
We believe that Tencent's ability to reach a large number of users, efficient and secure cloud computing capabilities and medical AI capabilities will all contribute to the long-term scientific research of academician Zhong Nanshan's team and more effectively prevent and control epidemics.



2. 2 seconds to identify novel coronavirus pneumonia, Tencent AI is helping three hospitals in Hubei.

In the face of novel coronavirus pneumonia patients' diagnosis and treatment, the demand for CT examination is increasing rapidly, and the CT equipment in front is very tight. Is there any artificial intelligence that can help front doctors improve their efficiency?

Yes! And today has begun to support the Hubei front hospital!

With the support of Tencent charity foundation, the emergency CT equipment carrying the latest "Tencent search for shadows" AI has gone to Hubei. Today, it will be deployed to Wuhan Xiehe Hospital, Wuhan rihai fangcang hospital and Honghu people's Hospital successively.

The Tencent search AI novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis solution can complete AI pattern recognition in the fastest 2 seconds after CT examination, and provide auxiliary diagnostic reference for doctors within 1 minutes.

Because the chest CT images can directly reflect the lung lesions, the front-line imaging doctors have a huge workload. Not only the suspected cases are excluded, but also the patients in the treatment period should have CT examination every 5 days on average.
However, a chest CT examination can often produce about 300 images, which will take 5-15 minutes for doctors to read only by naked eyes.

Since "Tencent search for shadow" can provide diagnosis reference within one minute, it means that it can help doctors to improve the efficiency of examination several times, so that patients can get more timely treatment.

In order to quickly support and put into use, Tencent's search for shadows adopts mobile emergency CT equipment, which not only facilitates the first time to rush to the scene of the epidemic, but also can be independent of the hospital or radiology department to avoid cross infection.

Meanwhile, the novel coronavirus pneumonia model was optimized by "Tencent search". AI can segment the area of pneumonia focus accurately, provide quantitative analysis of pneumonia focus, and help doctors accurately evaluate the severity and development process of pneumonia.

Next, Tencent search will also provide case follow-up so that doctors can compare patients' conditions and evaluate the treatment effect.
At present, Tencent charitable foundation is also organizing the second batch of special CT equipment for emergency response to help the forefront of anti epidemic in Hubei Province.
Another good news is that Tencent cloud has been promoting the deployment of this AI capability to the cloud to help more doctors and patients on the front line of anti epidemic







3. Attack "epidemic", Gaoxian robot assists in "virus cleaning war" ︱ Tencent AI accelerator · student dynamics

2019 novel coronavirus is more aggressive than the SARS virus in 2003. The wider transmission channels and faster transmission ability make the virus threaten people's health and declare its "strong". People raise their vigilance but don't need to panic, because medicine is improving, science and technology are improving, and human awareness of prevention is also improving.
The "epidemic" of Gaoxian robot can't be dismissed and the "control" can't be postponed
In this campaign without smoke of gunpowder, there was no onlooker, and a nationwide epidemic prevention and control interdiction war started rapidly. Hard core technology has played an important role in the "epidemic" of this war. Among them, a special defense line composed of driverless and robots: in the front line of the epidemic, it takes on the logistics support tasks such as cleaning and disinfection that humans had to face.
Founded in 2013, Shanghai Gaoxian robot is one of the earliest robot companies in the world engaged in independent mobile technology research and development and application exploration. At the same time, since the launch of Gaoxian commercial cleaning robot in 2014, it has also won the trust of 300 + customers in 15 + countries and regions by virtue of its wide range of scene applicability, and has been firmly in the top position of commercial landing in the track, "epidemic" is inevitable!


People and robots in the front line of "epidemic"
January 23rd
When the news of Wuhan Fengcheng came out, Gao Xian immediately set up a special front-line medical support team for the high risk of the epidemic and the high pressure of the hospital security system. To discuss and promote the donation of epidemic areas.
January 24th
On the eve of the lunar new year, Gao Xian's senior management team held an emergency meeting to clearly follow the guiding ideology of "the Party branch is built on the company": the CEO directly manages the special epidemic assistance, the general VP of the industry decentralized the medical line, and the medical director directly points to the front line.
January 25th
On the first day of the new year, Gao Xian's senior management team held an emergency meeting to discuss the pace of product line deployment, the cost, pace and response speed of special research and development. The meeting unanimously decided to supply on demand.
January 26th
On the second day of the lunar new year, an urgent and important announcement was issued, saying that Gao Xian would launch the research and development of medical cleaning robots to kill viruses more effectively. At the same time, free cleaning robots are provided to hospitals in need for automatic disinfection.
On the same day, the head logistics service providers of medical line such as medical housekeeper and rehabilitation Tianjian provided Gao Xian with a list of first-line hospitals to be supported, and put forward the demands of human-computer cooperation to support the front-line.
January 27th
On the third day of the new year, the CEO led the team to make a decision to give priority to hospital supply and resource mobilization.
...
In addition, in the face of the war "epidemic" during the Spring Festival, Gao Xian's core R &amp; D team, supply chain, logistics support line, and senior managers are all on standby, and all the staff are determined to fight every minute, no matter how many difficulties, Gao Xian people overcome one by one to ensure that the supporting robots are in place quickly.


The wind knows the grass, and the fire makes the gold. Fighting day and night, Gao Xian robot marched into the front line. In the Anti Japanese War, Gao Xian robot invested more than 3 million equipment to the center of the epidemic area, together with the first-line medical care to protect the people's life safety defense line. Up to now, the Chinese people's Liberation Army Central War Zone General Hospital, Chongqing public health center, Hong Kong University Shenzhen Hospital, Shanghai public health center, Hunan Xiangya Hospital and other places have been in place.
Help medical front line realize scientific prevention and control
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that the best way to control the epidemic is to find early isolation. The most thorough isolation and implementation is "nobody". Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist of China Center for Disease Control and prevention, said: "it's a good thing for disinfection robots to participate in anti epidemic war. It can reduce medical personnel's contact, treat patients and protect medical personnel at the same time." In this critical battle of epidemic situation, unmanned equipment has become an important "helper" to block the spread of epidemic situation with its high-efficiency and "zero contact" service.
Many hospitals and other public places have started the automatic cruise robot ground disinfection work in accordance with the emergency disinfection measures issued by the enterprise. The virus will soon subside with the droplets. Gaoxian robot uses the most traditional and effective way of hospital to wipe and disinfect the ground with disinfectant water, which can reduce the virus density to one thousandth. Unmanned driving reduces the risk of human infection. Excellent path planning ensures uniform and comprehensive disinfection of washing ground, and automatic cruise disinfection of washing ground does not need to disperse the crowd. At the same time, the use of cleaning robot disinfection can save 2 to 3 people's manpower and eliminate worries.



According to Xinhua news agency, not only in hospitals, but also in crowded public places, such as key areas from shopping malls to subway stations, the Gaoxian intelligent disinfection and cleaning robot can be all inclusive. Not only can it be eliminated accurately and quickly, but also can it not be! Sue! Interest! Give it a route and it will go on and on and on until the virus is eliminated. In addition, foreign media also had a high degree of concern about the epidemic, and Gao Xian was also caught in random interviews in Beijing Daxing airport, Shanghai Xingye Taiguhui and other landmark places.
There is no time to delay in the outbreak. The emergency support robot can only be used with the designated disinfectant. In addition to the epidemic, the future upgrading of the daily cleaning and disinfection system in public places is a long-term battle, and R &amp; D and innovation are unstoppable. Therefore, Gao Xian also set up a special research and development team for disinfection modules (modules can be disassembled and installed freely to meet different needs of users in daily and emergency situations). Cleaning and disinfection standards and property logistics data management ability (robot data upload integrated management platform) should be grasped. Public environmental health and safety is not only the battlefield of human beings, but also the hand of robots. We are jointly challenging higher environmental cleaning standards!
Cheng Haotian, CEO of Gaoxian robot, said: "the epidemic is coming. During the Spring Festival, there is a high risk period of personnel mobility. The hospital security system is facing double pressure. The epidemic has opened the real demand scenario of artificial intelligence, and also put forward a test to the technical strength of each artificial intelligence enterprise. For Gao Xian, it is responsibility, mission, opportunity and challenge. Novel coronavirus will respond to the proposal to give full play to the "artificial intelligence empowerment utility" to combat the new coronavirus infection, Gao Xian will actively respond to.




4. The first large-scale AI anti epidemic in history


Even people who don't usually have much interest in AI technology will notice the alphabet of AI in this special period.
In February 4th, novel coronavirus novel coronavirus infection was launched by the Ministry of industry and information technology, which called for the full use of artificial intelligence to fight the new coronavirus infection. It called for the use of AI technology to fill the short board of epidemic control and management technology, and fully excavate the application of AI Technology in the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection and epidemic prevention and control.
This may be the first government initiative in history to combine AI technology with the fight against the epidemic; this new type of coronary pneumonia in China, due to the special relationship between time and space, has become the first time that human beings have applied AI technology to large-scale public health events.
At this moment, all kinds of AI technologies and products in laboratories, hospitals, public transport hubs and communities are performing their respective duties and racing against the epidemic. Let's take a look at the role that AI technology has played under the epidemic situation, and what inspiration these roles have brought to AI industry, medical industry, and even all sectors of society.
Objectively speaking, AI technology only plays an auxiliary role in anti epidemic. But perhaps at the end of the epidemic, we will ask the question: after this test, can we and should we vigorously develop the intelligent process in the field of public health and medical research?
If the answer is yes, how can we find the future in lessons and experiences?
The background of the epidemic has always been cruelty, but human beings are often able to find a way out of cruelty. In the history of modern medicine, it is generally believed that the Spanish influenza in 1918 prompted human beings to complete the construction of modern public health protection system. So from the performance of AI in the anti epidemic battlefield, we may start to think more.
Virus analysis and vaccine development
After the outbreak of the epidemic, one of the first things announced by major cloud computing companies is to open AI computing power free to scientific research institutions and medical institutions.
At that time, many netizens were curious about the relationship between AI computing power and anti epidemic? Here is the essence of AI Computing: dealing with unstructured data matching through tensor computing.
In the classical computing environment, many unstructured data processing, such as image recognition, speech synthesis, gene matching, geological information computing, etc., can not get high efficiency computing. This makes AI computing need a separate computing chip and computing architecture, making AI computing power a key track for chip and cloud service manufacturers in recent years.
The industrial accumulation of AI computing power is just able to be used when the epidemic situation comes and the ability of medical analysis needs to be accelerated. In today's medical analysis field, virus gene sequencing, protein target screening, historical data matching of virus and drug research and development, all kinds of work need the support of AI computing power. At the same time, higher quality related algorithms can greatly improve the efficiency of related detection. These works are very important basic works for us to understand the nature of virus, analyze better treatment plans, and develop vaccines and targeted drugs, and the value is self-evident.

Although the role of AI computing in virus analysis and vaccine development is only to shorten the matching cycle and improve the detection efficiency, it can not complete vaccine development as we think, but open and abundant AI computing power is also very important in the anti epidemic battlefield.
At present, all major cloud computing companies have opened their AI computing power for free to meet the needs of anti epidemic. The novel coronavirus gene detection time is shortened by some technology companies that have free access to genetic testing technology to genetic testing institutions, epidemic prevention centers and academia.
In this anti epidemic campaign, the virus can be quickly isolated, the relevant gene sequencing can be completed, and the public can see the research information of relevant treatment drugs quickly come out, behind which the industry accumulation of AI computing power and algorithm has played a significant role.
Diagnostic aid
From scientific research institutions and laboratories to the front line of anti epidemic battlefield, AI can play a lot of key roles.
One of the most valuable anti epidemic robots at this stage is a robot with the ability of visual recognition and voice interaction, which can take the place of medical staff for patient care. The use of medical robots for the treatment of new pneumonia in the United States has recently been discussed at home. But medical robots need relatively mature industry support, so it is difficult to get on the horse quickly. At present, it has appeared to use AI robots in hotels for refitting, as part of drug delivery and medical supplies transmission tasks.
In the anti epidemic front line, the more helpful AI ability is diagnosis assistance, which is currently mainly focused on medical imaging + AI analysis ability. Within a week after the outbreak of the epidemic, many domestic AI technology companies began to enter major hospitals to provide intelligent systems based on medical image analysis for doctors and patients. Although the diagnosis of new pneumonia mainly needs reagents and other testing supplies, the lung image of patients also has a relatively strong distinguishing feature. Based on AI technology, traditional tests that take hours can be compressed in seconds. This ability effectively assisted the reagent detection, and provided help for rapid diagnosis and filling the shortage of medical personnel.
It can be predicted that the auxiliary diagnosis ability based on AI medical image will gradually move to the front line of anti epidemic in the next few days. AI companies have urgently strengthened their product capabilities in this field, and are also working more closely with medical research institutions.
Intelligent temperature measurement
With the arrival of the return tide, airports, stations, high-speed intersections and other public places have become key checkpoints for epidemic prevention and control. And the long line of temperature measurement in these places has become a helpless move in a special period. But this long wait will also cause large-scale crowd gathering, which obviously also brings risks for epidemic prevention.
In recent days, you may find that many places have turned on intelligent temperature measurement without waiting or removing masks, so that people can pass without feeling. In similar systems, AI is an indispensable link.
First, AI needs to lock face without picking up mask, accurately match the detected person and the test data, and then need the recognition and tracking of human body, simultaneous interpreting the temperature threshold of the sensor and giving warning to the body temperature abnormity. With infrared and visible light sensors, AI temperature measurement can significantly improve the passing efficiency of public places.
According to the relevant products on line in Beijing and other places at present, it can ensure the passing rate of 10-20 people per second for a single device, which has obviously equalled the normal passing efficiency of the import and export of railway stations, airports and subways.



In public places, AI's protection for epidemic prevention and control is also reflected in the field of public security. For example, AI camera can judge a person's activity track in public places through face recognition technology. This technology has not only improved the level of public security in recent years, but also played an important role in this epidemic prevention. For example, it will only have a contact history of more than ten seconds, and the infection process that the parties do not know is traced back, so as to avoid the large-scale fission transmission of the virus under unexpected circumstances.
The combination of public health security protection and AI technology is redefining the balance between safety and efficiency. It is believed that the application of AI in epidemic period will change the long-term construction of public health and safety system.
Smart phone
Another invisible area of prevention and control occurs in the telephone.
If you've been out in an outbreak, you may have received a call from AI. It will ask you about your experience of going out, time and place of going back and forth, as well as your physical condition after you return to your place of residence. These data are gathered through the AI outbound call system and become the data base of grassroots epidemic prevention and control.
Facing the huge population scale and Spring Festival travel scale, the community and grass-roots residents census and epidemic prevention notice have become a huge challenge in the actual implementation. The number of grass-roots people in the community is often small, and the anti epidemic affairs are extremely heavy and complex. It is obviously not appropriate to call continuously 24 hours a day. Therefore, the repeated work of calling has become a task that the grass-roots level cannot bear and must complete. In this case, the relatively perfect intelligent customer service system has become the key to break the situation.
AI customer service system based on intelligent call and voice interaction can be transformed into intelligent inspectors in a short time to complete personnel screening, return visit, notification and other matters, which is hundreds of times more efficient than artificial telephone.
Furthermore, some smart phone systems can also complete relatively complex anti epidemic investigation and return visit tasks, such as random investigation of users' investigation and living conditions to form sampling statistical data; and for example, continuous follow-up and return visit of key groups to form key prevention and control system.
At the same time, medical management units and grass-roots units at all levels can also develop more targeted smart phone system based on the current free and open smart phone capabilities, so that AI can become a part of social care and social ties in a special period.

Appeal
Looking back at the combination of AI and anti epidemic work, we can see that AI, unlike other technologies, can enter the core of anti epidemic work at all levels. For example, it is not difficult to find that the Internet can only solve the role of information transmission. Although this role is irreplaceable and very important, it can not directly accelerate virus analysis and vaccine development like AI.
The core working layers in all fields can be covered by AI, which is the prerequisite for the formation of AI technology under this anti epidemic test. At the same time, we should also see that the basic ability of AI technology is to improve industrial efficiency and replace part of repeated labor rather than human labor. In other words, AI is only an assistant in anti epidemic, but it is a very important assistant tool and accelerator. In general, we can see that in the epidemic prevention and control scenario, AI can play a role under three conditions:
1. The labor efficiency is slow and needs to be improved urgently. For example, intelligent temperature detection in public areas.
2. Large scale repetitive labor. For example, AI telephone census and notice.
3. Fuzzy data is difficult to complete with classical calculation mode. For example, AI virus gene sequencing.
These three working features of AI have been repeated many times. The reason why I want to emphasize it here is once. It is hoped to appeal to AI developers from all walks of life, as well as developers and manufacturers in the fields of medical products, genes and robots, once again attach importance to the basic capabilities of AI, find special scenarios among numerous anti epidemic demands, and give full play to their open capabilities and wisdom.
The current situation is that we can see that major AI companies and cloud computing manufacturers are rapidly using AI capabilities to develop related products and investing in the anti epidemic battlefield for free. However, the coverage ability of only a few head enterprises is obviously not enough, and a wide range of developers must participate in it to maximize the value of AI technology and enter the 2.0 stage of AI epidemic prevention and anti epidemic. At present, AI platform companies have begun to invest their individual AI capabilities into the anti epidemic battlefield. At the same time, they pay attention to empowering developers. With the help of open and technical models, they can find anti epidemic scenarios together, solve long tail needs, and improve the overall efficiency of the anti epidemic war.
This process may require the joint efforts and efficient communication of Internet companies, AI developers, and medical and scientific researchers. Today, many AI developers are eager to try, but they are not clear about the needs, data and standards of medical related scenarios. Medical workers are more involved in this design, which is also an important contribution to the anti epidemic battlefield.



enlightenment
I have no intention to praise the contribution of AI technology and industry in epidemic prevention. After all, it is far from the time to praise and summarize. Moreover, in the anti epidemic battlefield, AI is definitely not the main role, but its auxiliary functions in many key areas can still show us some future possibilities. We certainly hope that one day, AI can play the leading role in public health protection. After all, more AI means less sacrifice for medical workers.
This is the first time that AI has stepped into anti epidemic on a large scale. Although major AI companies have demonstrated full response speed and social responsibility, we still need to see the whole social system and medical system, and the inclusion and use of AI technology are relatively rudimentary. For example:
1. AI capabilities are not widely recognized by users.
This time, AI quickly went to the anti epidemic battlefield, mainly relying on the cloud + AI base, which has formed a high degree of completion and basically reached the feature of ready to use. However, the AI capabilities provided to the anti epidemic front-line are relatively single, lack of sufficient scene coverage, and many of them can only be used in small-scale in the first-line cities, unable to enter the epidemic core areas such as Wuhan in the first time, indicating that the industrial integration needs to be improved.
We can think of AI as a combination of a large number of basic capabilities and basic algorithms, which can assemble various capabilities at any time and solidify into specific products and platforms. However, in this anti epidemic campaign, it can be seen that the developers of medical front-line, medical research and scientific and technological industries are not familiar with these capabilities, and need to spend a lot of time communicating with each other. This also leads to a lot of good AI capabilities that cannot be quickly promoted nationwide and key areas can not be settled in.
2. The software and hardware industry chain is relatively weak.
AI has a good performance in the anti epidemic battlefield, but it can also be seen that these performances mainly come from the software level. It's hard to see AI robots and IOT hardware moving quickly to the front line of anti epidemic. There are no medical robots equipped with cameras, microphones, stethoscopes and other equipment that can be remotely controlled by the front-line medical staff. From the present of software AI to the future of AI robot, what we need is a well structured AI + IOT industrial chain. The weakness of hardware ecology makes the intelligent efficiency of many industries in China as expected. This is also a problem that must be faced and solved in the next science and technology cycle.
3. The overall level of intelligence in the field of public health needs to be improved.
AI has done a lot to fight the epidemic. But maybe we still need to ask, logically, whether AI can make more contribution to the epidemic prevention? The answer is obviously yes. For example, there are AI start-ups in the United States that predict new pneumonia through social network data. Can this be a possibility for the future? Let AI warn us, so as to avoid "whistle blowing" in the sea of social media.
For example, the intelligent management of public health system and the intelligent allocation of emergency materials have emerged complete solutions in these fields. But because these abilities need long-term preparation, they are not seen in this anti epidemic. For example, in recent hot events, some organizations proposed that the material allocation was not timely because there were too few staff. Can AI be unmanned? This is not uncommon in the scene of intelligent industry and intelligent logistics, but it has not become a living force in the anti epidemic battlefield.
The cruelty and horror of the epidemic have been deeply understood by everyone. There is no doubt that we will overcome the epidemic and soon achieve it. But at the same time, we should also consider what we left behind after the outbreak? When the epidemic situation disappears, whether we need to put forward some possibilities: for example, to comprehensively upgrade the public health and epidemic prevention technology system around intelligent technology; for example, to increase the investment in intelligent medical treatment, especially in the field of vaccine development, virus research and new drug development; for example, whether we should introduce and improve the hardware industry chain, and let AI robots replace medical care workers The author, becomes the future infectious disease clinical front line soldier.
Maybe these problems are not only about AI technology, medical industry, and the epidemic. But reflection and action are always timely.




5. Eight development trends of AI in 2020



In the past year, the heat of artificial intelligence has fallen, the noise has faded, landing as the main theme; and in the precipitation, it has become mature, affecting all aspects of people's daily life.
2020 has come, and the heat of artificial intelligence is still there. Industry experts predict that in 2020, artificial intelligence will continue to turn the imagined field of technological progress into reality and popularization, which is absolutely beyond people's imagination.
So, in 2020, what is the trend of the development of artificial intelligence? Let's know in advance according to the known data and the predictions of scientists and entrepreneurs:
Automatic driving: safety supervision is the problem
Automatic driving is one of the most concerned application scenarios in artificial intelligence industry. At CES 2020, which recently ended, automakers and technology companies showed off the latest results of autonomous driving.
For example, Honda, BMW, Ericsson, etc. have brought their own self driving concept cars; Qualcomm, Baidu, horizon, etc. have demonstrated their own self driving solutions; livox (Lanwo Technology), a subsidiary incubated in Xinjiang, has launched two lidar products for L3 or L4 level self driving. According to bi intelligence, a research organization of business insider, the global car ownership with automatic driving function will reach about 10 million by 2020.
For example, Stefan ortmann, one of the founders of cerence company, believes that at present, autonomous driving needs to overcome more than technology, so safety and cost must be considered. It may take 2030-2040 to realize the above vision. Xiao Jianxiong, founder and CEO of auto x, said the vision could come true in 2023. In his view, technology is no longer a problem, focusing on when the government will open up driverless vehicles to the road.
There may be some new controversies about the ethics of autopilot. Nauto CEO Stefan Heck believes that autopilot should be designed to break the legal restrictions. It must learn to speed and match the speed of other drivers in order to ensure the safety of other drivers. For example, in a car accident, if speeding can save more lives, AI must learn to violate the law / driving rules. In 2020, we will see more arguments about designing illegal behavior algorithms.



Retail: AI is increasingly used as marketing recommendation
The essence of retailing is the "market" that connects "people" (consumers) and "goods" (commodities). New retail is a more efficient innovation attempt on the three key elements of "people, goods and market". The realization of new retail can not do without artificial intelligence technology.
Amazon go, which is famous for its unmanned retail business, has made great strides in opening 10 stores in the United States in 2019, and is expected to open more than 3000 physical stores in the United States by 2021. According to the latest estimate of Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), the income of Amazon go is about 50% higher than that of ordinary convenience stores, and the average annual income is estimated to be $1.5 million, and it is predicted that Amazon go will reach the scale of $4.5 billion by 2021.
Amazon Go, based on the computer vision algorithm, applies the new technology "Just Walk Out", which is similar to the way that an autopilot works. Amazon calls it "the most advanced shopping technology in the world", and its greatest convenience lies in taking away.
But Trey Courtney, moodmedia's global chief product officer, said: 'we are very early in using AI in retail. So far, most of the use is in the supply chain, such as automated inventory data management and customer service (answering questions through chat robots). I believe we will see more retailers deploy AI technologies, such as cameras that measure store traffic and adjust digital screen content, and voice assistants that customers can use when they shop in stores.
George Bory, managing director of activeviam, predicts that retailers will increasingly make marketing recommendations for AI, and many retailers will strive to translate these AI decisions into business rules for pricing, supply chain and commodity sales. But not all companies realize that moving AI technology into data analysis is just the first step in the real transformation process.
Digital economy companies: helping small businesses simplify processes
The white paper "Chinese enterprise 2020: AI application practice and trend" points out that technology is the first driving force for the rise of Alibaba, Tencent and other digital economy companies, and digital innovation will become the theme of "Chinese enterprise 2020".
Morgan Stanley has equipped 16000 of its financial advisors with machine learning algorithms, freeing them from repetitive tasks and making them more focused on customer service. In 2020, more and more enterprises will use AI to change their business model, business process, business structure, and product application.
Phil Grier, a small business business engineer at Yahoo, said that by 2020, artificial intelligence will help narrow the business capacity gap faced by many small businesses with limited resources. With AI, small businesses can achieve better inventory and delivery management through automated workflow (such as employee management, it service management or compliance management), and manage their stores seamlessly and efficiently. Chat robots and virtual assistants based on Artificial Intelligence further simplify business transactions, improve operational efficiency and provide the best customer experience.




AI chip: increasingly fierce market competition
For the AI chip industry, 2020 will be the most important year so far.
Baidu Research Institute released the forecast of top ten science and technology trends in 2020, saying that in recent years, AI chips have gradually reached the available state, and 2020 will be the key year for the large-scale implementation of AI chips. At the same time, NPU (neural network processing unit) will become the basic module of the next generation end-side general CPU chip. In the future, more and more end-side CPU chips will take deep learning as the core to carry out new chip planning. In addition to the chip, AI will redefine the computer architecture and support AI training and predictive computing as a new idea of heterogeneous design architecture.
Therefore, the competition will be particularly fierce. It is unknown who will dominate the AI chip market in 2020.
In addition, the wave of AI chip acquisition will also suddenly rise. In December 2019, Intel acquired Habana labs, an Israeli manufacturer of artificial intelligence chips, which showed some clues. The market is full of a large number of chip start-ups, many of which are mature and have begun to produce measurable results. As established semiconductor companies realize the importance of AI chips and AI will rapidly occupy the vertical market, these start-ups may seek to implement their own strategies through acquisition.
In 2020, it should be the key year for AI chips to compete in the field.
Medical field: a year when artificial intelligence becomes the mainstream
In the direction of health care, AI technology opens a new era of intelligent medical care. At present, AI technology can analyze the collected health data to make the medical process more efficient. For example, human body data can be collected through wearable devices. Through AI technology, these devices are expected to become people's personal health assistants. Even assist doctors to provide more accurate services for patients, for example, AI viewing can release doctors' time, AI technology will be a good helper for doctors, improve work efficiency and improve diagnosis and treatment level at the same time. In addition, with the deployment of 5g network, telemedicine has become possible.
Dave costenaro, chief data officer of capacity, said that by 2020, AI is expected to make significant progress in healthcare. From biology to backstage to clinic, medicine is full of complex and multivariable problems, which is an ideal platform for machine learning algorithm. But there are still many problems to be solved in AI, such as patient privacy, bias of training data, and coordination between human and algorithm, which are not insurmountable, but can be overcome by thoughtful and disciplined methods. The potential benefits are so great that I believe AI will make significant progress in this area.
Elad walach, co founder and executive officer of aidoc, predicted that 2020 would be the year when artificial intelligence became the mainstream in the medical field. 2019 is the early year of AI adoption. After that, with the spread of AI reputation in the society, more medical centers will begin to realize the benefits of AI. On the contrary, this will lead to a decrease in the overall number of AI medical companies, because there will be winners and losers.





Education: providing a more personalized path
The application of AI in education is also hot. For example, the global education program has been transformed into different applications integrating AI, online colleges are emerging around the world, various learning robot applications and so on.
In the new year, we will witness the transformation of educational informatization from "Internet plus education" to "intelligence + education". A few days ago, New Oriental released the top ten trends of education and technology in 2020. It shows that in 2020, AI technology will play an increasingly important role in the whole teaching link before, during and after class. In some subjects, there will be AI teachers, who can complete the teaching work without the participation of real teachers.
In addition, in terms of big data, personalized education will be enabled. Educational institutions will build a more mature and systematic teaching / knowledge label system to complete the systematization of teaching information. There will be short video fragmentation and personalized education products in the field of education. Teachers' training will also be widely personalized.
Kanuj Malhotra, President of bned digital student solutions, believes that higher education will continue to see the value of AI in 2020. We will see that AI is more and more widely used in learning tools. These tools can predict the use of various disciplines, especially in stem, which can provide students with a more personalized path. In addition, in the qualitative analysis of writing (including argument structure, relevance and style), artificial intelligence will make higher education use more writing solutions based on artificial intelligence.
Employment: AI will create a new career
Although many people are worried about the large-scale unemployment caused by AI, the technology will also create new jobs. According to the prediction of Gartner, a research institution, 2020 will be a key year for the development of AI related businesses. There will be 1.8 million jobs replaced by AI, but at the same time, 2.3 million new jobs will be created.
In November 2019, the China employment training technology guidance center under the Ministry of human resources and Social Security announced a number of new jobs to be released, including many related to the intelligent industry, such as artificial intelligence trainers, UAV tooling, intelligent manufacturing engineering technicians, etc. Taking the artificial intelligence trainer as an example, when training the artificial intelligence model, a lot of data is needed, and the quality of training data is directly related to the final overall performance of the product, which requires the artificial intelligence trainer to clean, label and classify the data.
AI technology talents will meet the golden development opportunity, while talents in other industries will also face the assessment of AI interviewers.
Eric sydel, executive vice president of modern hire innovation recruitment, said that by 2020, we expect the talent recruitment team to continue to use artificial intelligence to promote fairness, better predict recruitment, simplify processes and improve candidate experience. The talent recruitment team will also use artificial intelligence to better predict the possibility of candidates' success in the work, implement deviation control, and provide real-time feedback to candidates. As AI continues to play an important role in recruitment, organizations must ensure that their recruitment techniques are conducive to individual candidates and adopt transparent, verifiable, replicable and publishable open standards.

Data challenge: there will be new solutions
The four foundations of AI are knowledge, data, algorithm and computing power. Looking back on history, these four factors are constantly playing a role.
The first generation of artificial intelligence, also known as symbolic artificial intelligence, emphasizes the role of knowledge in intelligence, because at that time, algorithms and computing power have not kept up with each other. After entering the new century, deep learning has focused everyone's goals on data, but it seems that the artificial intelligence system built according to big data is not credible, reliable, safe and easy to promote, which are the problems brought by the current AI research with deep learning, also can be said to be the challenges encountered by big data.
How to solve this challenge? Zhang cymbal, President of the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Tsinghua University and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the only way is to reintroduce knowledge, combine data-driven with knowledge-driven, and achieve a credible and secure third-generation artificial intelligence.
Ranael kaliouby, co-founder and CEO of affectiva, proposed that we will see the rise of data synthesis methods to meet the data challenges in artificial intelligence. The AI algorithm based on deep learning can work correctly only after being trained and verified on a large number of data, but the AI companies often face the challenge of obtaining accurate data. To solve this problem, companies can synthesize the collected data to create new data. Data synthesis does not eliminate the need to collect real-world data, but it can expand the data set, which is essential for developing more accurate AI algorithms.
Cloudian CMO jontoor focuses on data storage. As the volume of data continues to explode, he said, one of the key challenges is how to capture the full strategic value of the data. Object storage will help handle artificial intelligence and multilingual workloads in 2020, because this new storage architecture uses metadata in a way that traditional file storage does not.
Although in the process of in-depth industrial landing, artificial intelligence still faces many challenges. However, there is no doubt that artificial intelligence will bring about a revolutionary reconstruction of the global innovation landscape, economic structure and human life style. In the next decade, it will be the outbreak period of the accelerated popularization of artificial intelligence technology. In 2020, no matter the country, enterprise or individual, they should bravely face this big test of artificial intelligence, seize the opportunity and seek steady development.






6. Megengine, a domestic deep learning framework, is built by Kuang Shi and will be open source by the end of March




What kind of deep learning framework should we choose in 2020? Now there is a new choice. According to reliable news, the core deep learning framework from Kuangshi brain + + will be open-source by the end of March. Kuang Shi will give its powerful computing power, various SOTA models and framework resources to all developers and university teachers and students through open source and open form.
This framework, which is completely independently developed by Chinese people and has supported all leading technologies, is bound to attract widespread attention.
Before we introduce megengine, we have to introduce brain + +, an artificial intelligence algorithm platform of broad vision. Sun Jianzeng, chief scientist and President of Kuang Shi Research Institute, said: "Kuang Shi brain + + makes large-scale algorithm training possible. Simply understand that brain + + with batch production algorithm is a leap of productivity for Kuang Shi. Let the developers of Kuangshi quickly embark on the process of modernization from the pioneer period.

Kuangshi brain + + can be generally divided into three parts, of which the open-source deep learning algorithm development framework megengine is the core, followed by the deep learning cloud computing platform megcompute which provides computing power scheduling support, and the data management platform megdata which is used to provide data services and management. The reason why Kuang Shi, which originated from computer vision, has been developing rapidly in AI competitions, is that Kuang Shi has realized small steps and self-sufficiency in algorithm innovation through brain + +. Further research shows that the most fundamental reason for its success is that the core framework effect of Kuang Shi is indeed extraordinary.
However, with the continuous open-source AI tools of various manufacturers, what consideration has Kuang Shi put his "killer mace" into the whole community? This also starts from the development process of deep learning framework.



The way of domestic deep learning framework
What is a framework? That is, the predecessors have opened up a road, and the latecomers only need to follow this road.
As we all know, the emergence of deep learning is the turning point of the development curve of artificial intelligence industry. However, the early R &amp; D personnel had no way to go. In the embryonic stage of deep learning, the elder framework like theano once guided us to write the first batch of powerful neural networks; later, successors such as tensorflow gradually made the preparation of neural networks as simple as building blocks.
Many of the first explorers of deep learning are well-known overseas scholars, and the deep learning framework they rely on is mostly created and maintained by overseas developers. From the theono and Caffe framework proposed by Montreal University and Berkeley University to tensorflow and pytorch maintained by Google and Facebook, the mainstream of deep learning framework has changed from academic institutions to technology giants.
Since the framework is basically open-source, do domestic technology enterprises need to develop a new one? The answer is yes. The reason why DL framework is transferred from universities to enterprises is that AI is not limited to the knowledge in ivory tower, but must face the real scene problems; it is because they can be used in production and can act on various practical businesses. At present, there are many leading technology enterprises in China, which have unique business scenarios and problems. This provides an opportunity to develop an independent deep learning framework and build a more perfect hardware and algorithm system. Baidu's open-source paddlepaddle has excellent accumulation in natural language processing and other aspects; Huawei's upcoming open-source mindspore emphasizes the ability of software and hardware coordination and mobile terminal deployment.
The choice of open source tools is like the problem of "what is the best computer language". Developers have their own preferences and slots. From the current situation, pytorch and tensorflow are undoubtedly the most popular, and the domestic framework is developing actively.
However, as a leading start-up company in the world of computer vision technology, tensorflow or pytorch has never been used in the research and development of AI technology and products in Kuang Shi Research Institute. At the beginning of Kuang Shi's establishment, AI development tools were scarce. Kuang Shi formed his own set of fighting methods and created a set of tools that he could use easily.

 In 2014, Kuang Research Institute set up megengnie, the core engine of brain + +, and popularized the algorithm framework in the company. With the accumulation of Kuang Shi in massive computer vision tasks and business scenarios, this deep learning framework has been polished in Kuang Shi. There are more than 1400 developers of Kuang Shi who are using their own framework training and deployment algorithms. Even if new students join in, they can learn quickly and integrate into the R &amp; D ecology of Kuang Shi.
The whole framework of megengine
It is understood that based on this framework throughout the company's R &amp; D process, Kuang Shi has developed a series of deep neural networks that can be deployed in the cloud, edge side and mobile end. For example, shufflenet, which has a great impact on the industry, is a highly efficient and lightweight convolutional neural network for mobile terminals. It can achieve 20 times faster speed than alexnet on ARM based mobile devices, and the efficiency is even higher than Google's mobilenet.
Today, Kuangshi megengine has been polished for more than five years. On the basis of deep learning framework, Kuangshi upgraded this set of AI development tools to a suite of tools, and integrated data management and computing resources planning and framework into a platform - brain + + was born. At least for Kuangshi, this set of Trinity algorithm platform is to improve AI The foundation of enterprise productivity.
With such an end-to-end solution, Kuang Shi has repeatedly won the world's artificial intelligence competitions. From 2017 to 2019, Kuang Shi won the third consecutive title of coco. Coco is the most influential general object detection challenge in the field of artificial intelligence, and enjoys a high reputation in the field of computer vision.
The efficiency and ease of use of this productivity platform comes from practice. It is a more practical way to build a framework based on the real needs of the business. All major domestic autonomous AI frameworks are actively exploring their direction. For developers, with the results of their exploration, they can make the most suitable and easy-to-use algorithms for domestic business scenarios. Because the independent AI framework is very meaningful, Kuang's efforts have also been supported by the state.
In August 2019, at the waic AI conference, Kuang Shi, together with Huawei, JD, Ping An, Xiaomi and other enterprises, was selected as the national AI open innovation platform. In terms of image perception, the Ministry of science and technology announced that it will build a "new generation of national AI open innovation platform for image perception" based on the artificial intelligence algorithm platform brain + + independently developed by Kuang Shi and its integrated capacity. The platform will be open to national researchers to help realize the deployment of advanced deep neural network in cloud, mobile and edge computing platforms.


Light, easy to use, open source megengine
According to self use experience, the internal R &amp; D personnel of Kuang vision introduced that the architecture of megengine is advanced and supports the integration of training and reasoning. Developers can use the latest technology, the most reasonable API, and the best presentation method to realize their own ideas, with unique features in performance, ease of use, etc.
At present, the megengine mainly supports the algorithm development work inside the vision, especially the depth optimization of computer vision and large-scale distributed training. After five years of industrial practice and the verification of "body through the centenary", Kuangshi megengine is gradually maturing, and some unique characteristics are gradually highlighted.
 
First, in terms of operation speed, Kuangshi megengine has a high-performance computing core, and the memory optimization mechanism of dynamic and static combination has faster operation speed and takes up less memory resources; secondly, in terms of ease of use, megengine encapsulates the platform details, and the interface is compatible with pytorch, so new users can start quickly; finally, megengine It also supports a variety of hardware platforms and heterogeneous computing. The whole framework can be used for training and reasoning at the same time. It can achieve one-time model training and multi device deployment, which can avoid the performance degradation and accuracy loss caused by unnecessary conversion process.
In addition to the above performance, megengine is also said to have made special optimization for IOT and visual tasks, widely supporting various chips. Through leading quantitative computing support, it can support multiple devices through a unified quantitative model, and support network reasoning lower than 8 bit.
Sitting on the broad vision of the computer vision factory and the position of AI unicorn, they have made great progress on the way of AI industry. Now they hope to open their own development tools in an open and open way Feedback to future generations, help teachers and students, traditional industries and small and medium-sized enterprises in the development of artificial intelligence algorithm, in order to reduce the threshold of integration of traditional industries and artificial intelligence technology, and stimulate more people to participate in the construction of artificial intelligence ecology.
AI is expected to raise the annual growth rate of China's economy from 6.3% to 7.9% by 2035, according to the report "artificial intelligence: boosting China's economic growth" released by Accenture recently. In the future, artificial intelligence will contribute to economic development. In this process, we will master more and more core technologies of our own.
Open source of Kuangshi megengine may be the beginning.
