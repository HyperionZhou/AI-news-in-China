# AI breaks through the core of high numbers, accurately solves differential equations and indefinite integrals within 1 second, and has far better performance than Matlab
Everyone knows that AI (Neural Network) can't even do simple arithmetic like addition and subtraction:


But now, AI already knows calculus and stretches the magic claw towards your favorite high number.

It will not only find indefinite integrals:


Can also solve ordinary differential equations:


First order and second order are fine.

This is a new model published by Facebook. The answer given in 1 second surpassed the 30-second performance of Mathematica and Matlab.

The team said that this is the result of Seq2Seq and Transformer.

Using natural language processing (NLP) to understand mathematics works.

This result has received 1,700 likes on Twitter. Many little friends expressed surprise

Generating poses for huge data sets

To train a model to do a calculus problem, the most important prerequisite is a large and large data set.

Here are the manufacturing methods for the integral dataset and the ordinary differential equation dataset:

Function, and its integral

The first is to make a data pair like "a function & its differential". The team used three methods:

The first is forward generation (Fwd), which refers to generating a random function (up to n operators) and then using existing tools to find the integral. Throw away functions that the tool cannot find.

The second is backward generation (Bwd), which refers to generating a random function and then deriving the function. Filled up some functions that the first method could not collect, because even if the tool can't find the integral, it can definitely be derived.

The third is inverse generation (Ibp) using segment integrals.

Treat mathematics as natural language

Integral and differential equations can both be regarded as transforming one expression into another. Researchers believe that this is a special case of machine translation and can be solved by NLP.

The first step is to represent the mathematical expression as a tree.

Operators and functions are internal nodes, and numbers, constants, and variables are leaf nodes.

The second step is to introduce the seq2seq model.
The seq2seq model has two important characteristics:
Both input and output sequences can have any length, and the lengths can be different.
The words in the input and output sequences do not need to correspond one-to-one.
Therefore, the seq2seq model is very suitable for solving calculus problems.
To generate a tree using the seq2seq model, first, map the tree to a sequence.
Using prefix notation, write each parent node before its child nodes, listed from left to right.
For example 2 + 3 * (5 + 2), expressed as a tree is:
Expressed as a sequence is [+ 2 * 3 + 5 2].
There is also a one-to-one mapping between the tree and the prefix sequence.
The third step is to generate a random expression.
To create training data, you need to generate random mathematical expressions. The generation strategy of the data set has been introduced earlier, and the algorithm for generating random expressions is emphasized here.
It is not easy to uniformly sample expressions using n internal nodes. For example, methods such as recursion tend to generate deep trees instead of wide trees, and left-side trees instead of right-side trees. In fact, it is impossible to generate different types of trees with the same probability.
Therefore, taking a random binary tree as an example, the specific method is: starting from an empty root node, and determining the position of the next internal node in the empty node at each step. Repeat until all internal nodes are allocated.
However, under normal circumstances, the mathematical expression tree is not necessarily a binary tree, and the internal node may have only one child node. In this way, it is necessary to consider the two-dimensional probability distribution of the number of parameters of the root node and the next internal node, denoted as L (e, n).
The next step is to sample the random tree and randomly select internal nodes and leaf nodes from the list of possible operators and integers, variables, and constants to "decorate" the tree.
Finally, the number of expressions is calculated.
From the previous steps, you can see that the expression is actually composed of a limited set of variables, constants, integers, and a series of operators.
The problem can then be summarized as:
Tree with up to n internal nodes
A set of p1 unary operators (such as cos, sin, exp, log)
A set of p2 binary operators (such as +,-, ×, pow)
A set of L leaf values, which include variables (such as x, y, z), constants (such as e, π), and integers (such as {-10,…, 10})
If p1 = 0, the expression is represented by a binary tree.
In this way, a binary tree with n internal nodes happens to have n + 1 leaf nodes. Each node and leaf can take p1 and L different values, respectively.
The number of expressions with n binary operators can be expressed as:
If p1> 0, the number of expressions is:
It can be observed that the number of leaf nodes and binary operators can significantly affect the size of the problem space.
△ Number of expressions for different numbers of operators and leaf nodes
Better than business software
In experiments, researchers trained a seq2seq model to predict a solution to a given problem. The model used is an 8 attention head, 6-layer, 512-dimensional Transformer model.
Researchers evaluated the accuracy of the model in solving calculus equations in a data set of 5,000 equations.
The results show that for differential equations, beam search decoding can greatly improve the accuracy of the model.
Compared with the most advanced commercial scientific computing software, the new model is not only faster, but also more accurate.
On a test set containing 500 equations, the best performing commercial software is Mathematica.
For example, in the first-order differential equation, compared with the new model using the greedy search decoding algorithm (bunch size is 1), Mathematica does not fall, but the new method can usually solve the equation in less than 1 second, and Mathematica's problem solving time It is much longer (the time limit is 30s, if it exceeds 30s, it is regarded as no solution).
When the new method performs a beam search with a size of 50, the model accuracy improves from 81.2% to 97%, which is far better than Mathematica (77.2%).
And, for some problems that Mathematica and Matlab cannot solve, the new model gives effective solutions.
△ Commercial scientific computing software did not find a solution to the equation
Invite AI to IMO
The appearance of this AI that can solve calculus has attracted the attention of many netizens and caused heated discussions. Netizens have praised: goose sister-in-law.
Some netizens said:
What's super interesting about this paper is that it has the potential to solve problems where the complexity is much higher than the integral.
Some netizens believe that this research is too cool, and the model can summarize and integrate some functions that cannot be achieved by sympy.
However, some netizens believe that in comparison with Mathematica, the experimental settings of researchers do not appear to be rigorous enough.
By default, Mathematica performs calculations in the complex field, which makes its operation more difficult. But the author considers expressions containing complex coefficients to be "invalid." So when they used Mathematica, adjusted the setting to the real number field?

I am curious if Mathematica can solve problems that the system cannot solve.

The 30s limit is a bit arbitrary for computer algebra systems.
In short, in the face of increasingly intelligent AI, some people have already launched a challenge and invited AI to challenge the IMO gold medal.

# 港 大 大学 | Emerging majors for the future: analysis of fintech and applied artificial intelligence courses

In the 2019/20 school year, the University of Hong Kong has launched a series of new interdisciplinary undergraduate courses in Bachelor of Arts, aimed at training leaders who will lead new industries in the future and create new opportunities in the future. This article will introduce you to the Bachelor of Arts (Financial Technology) and Bachelor of Arts (Applied Artificial Intelligence) in the Bachelor of Arts series.

University of Hong Kong
Bachelor of Arts (FinTech)
BASc (FinTech)
Bachelor of Arts (Fintech) trains Fintech experts and entrepreneurs with financial and technological knowledge. Graduates will lead the innovation and application of Fintech in the future. The course was designed by the HKU School of Engineering, the School of Economics and Business Administration, and other colleges.
The first high-frequency vocabulary that has risen in the financial circle in the past few years is FinTech.
In recent years, approximately one-third of analysts and employees of the JPMorgan Chase Group have started to teach themselves programming; Goldman Sachs' engineering department has thrown olive branches to FinTech students in 2020; MIT and other famous universities have successively launched online FinTech certification courses; The recruitment of FinTech Guan Peisheng for the freshmen of 19 years has been started; the CFA, the first major financial test, has also added FinTech content ...

Goldman Sachs has reported that in the financial industry, "conservatively predicts that by 2025, machine learning and artificial intelligence can save costs and bring in new business profits, which can create value of about $ 34 billion to $ 43 billion per year." Don't know FinTech, It is tantamount to actively exiting future financial markets.
Pt.1

FINTECH
  What exactly is FinTech?

FinTech = Finance + Technology. Regarding its connotation, the International Financial Stability Board (FSB) gives an internationally accepted standard definition:
"Financial innovation brought by technology can generate new business models, applications, processes or products, which can have a significant impact on the way financial markets, financial institutions or financial services are provided."

One of the simplest and most everyday examples. Nowadays, we scan every day on WeChat & Alipay, Apple Pay, etc., which is a major change in the economic model brought by FinTech.

The scope of FinTech is far beyond "electronic payment". In fact, as long as the application of technology in the financial industry, it belongs to the category of financial technology. For example, the cutting-edge technologies we know well in recent years-artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain, cryptography, cloud computing, etc.-have been the research objects of fintech.



With emerging technologies, FinTech's range of financial services is also very broad. It is being applied to all aspects of the financial industry: lending, managing wealth, payments, insurance, crowdfunding, credit reporting, and even retail and housing agencies.

Also brought us the experience of the TAs:

Xiao Chengyuan
Chongqing Nankai Middle School
"Choosing fintech is my interest. After one semester of study at the University of Hong Kong, fintech is no longer a" advanced "concept for me, and the innovation and application of technology has more practical significance. After blockchain technology, everyone knows that cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin) are the most famous applications, but in fact, blockchain can be applied in various industries, such as insurance, financial asset settlement, digital services, anti-counterfeiting, etc. .

Technology in FinTech can span multiple fields, which in turn requires the support and innovation of multiple technologies in the same field. FinTech is really a huge, complex, yet interesting and challenging field. "

Gu Yining
Harbin No.3 Middle School
"I wanted to choose a major in computer and financial research at the time. Fintech was the best choice. The University of Hong Kong's Fintech course included a wide range of content and a high degree of freedom. NLP, network security, etc. are all involved, so that we can choose the areas that we want to study in advanced grades. In addition, the Fintech course belongs to the Bachelor of Arts and Sciences. Leadership courses, followed by big data courses, etc. "
